# [Take: mobile app landing page template](https://jasonbaciulis.github.io/take-app-landing-page/) 

Take is a fictitious mobile app for taking photos and adding effects. It was built on Bootstrap 4 and is fully responsive accross all devices.

For parallax scrolling effect I used [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) animation platform and [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/).

Here you can find the [PSD design template](http://blazrobar.com/free-psd-website-templates/take-a-free-mobile-app-landing-page-psd-template/) created by [Blaz Robar](http://blazrobar.com/).

## This project utilizes the best performance optimization practises using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/):

* All assets are minified, images and SVGs are optimized.
* For faster page load render blocking CSS is inlined in HTML and loaded asynchronously using [loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) function and [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical).
* Unused Bootstrap CSS is removed with [Purify CSS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/purifycss-webpack).
* All external scripts are loaded from CDNs and are either defered or loaded async.
